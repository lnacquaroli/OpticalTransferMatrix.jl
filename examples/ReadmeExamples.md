## Examples

Here we store few examples of different configurations of multilayer stacks to provide an outlook on how to use `TMMOptics.jl` module

#### arCoating.jl

Provides an example of simulation of an antireflection coating with three active layers, air with incident medium and silicon as substrate.

#### braggStack.jl

Provides an example of simulation of 1d photonic crystal (Distributed Bragg Reflector), with air with incident medium and silicon as substrate, and two different alternated layers.

#### fabryPerot.jl

Provides an example of simulation of 1d photonic crystal with a defect inside given by a thicker layer, with air with incident medium and silicon as substrate, and two different alternated layers.

#### singleLayer.jl

Provides an example of simulation of single thin film layer, with air with incident medium and silicon as substrate.
